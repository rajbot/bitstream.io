[IA BookReader](https://github.com/openlibrary/bookreader)       | I rewrote the IA bookreader in 2007 as a web app that allowed users to view full-resolution archival images of books scanned by the Internet Archive. Since then, Michael Ang, George Oates, and several others provided significant updates and a new design. The latest improvements I added were support for [online loans through Open Library](http://openlibrary.org/borrow) and text-to-speech. I continue to maintain this project, but further development has stopped. ([github](https://github.com/openlibrary/bookreader))
[Open Library](http://openlibrary.org/)                          | Open Library is an online catalog of book metadata, striving to be "one webpage for every book ever published". It was started by Aaron Swartz and is now maintained by Anand Chitipothu. I served as Tech Lead of Open Library for a while. Further developement on OL has stopped. ([github](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary))
[autocrop](https://github.com/rajbot/autocrop)                   | I wrote a JS webapp called RePublisher, which was used for digitizing microfilm and is now used in IA's book scanning centers. The C code that automatically crops book images is [available on github](https://github.com/rajbot/autocrop). It was originally written as a side-project, and I could use help updating the code.
[Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web/web.php)                | I've worked on a [Python SURT module](https://github.com/rajbot/surt), a [CDX Writer](https://github.com/rajbot/CDX-Writer), the [liveweb proxy](https://github.com/internetarchive/liveweb) and a [S3 uploader daemon](https://github.com/internetarchive/s3_loader).
[IA Python Library](https://github.com/jjjake/ia-wrapper)        | Jake Johnson has written a great python and command-line interface to IA storage. I've been contributing improvements, and find this project quite useful. ([github](https://github.com/jjjake/ia-wrapper))
[gPhoto camera drivers](http://www.gphoto.org)                   | I got to work with Paul Walmsley when he added gphoto and linux kernel support for the Canon 5D camera, used in the IA scanning centers. [Here are our notes](/category/bookscanning.html) from reverse-engineering Canon drivers.
[IA HTML5 Uploader](http://archive.org/upload/)                  | I am working on the IA HTML5 Uploader, which was originally developed by Michael Ang. Although it is part of the archive.org php codebase and not available on github, the uploader is almost entirely a [javascript web app](http://archive.org/upload/app/js/ia_uploader.js).
Open Source IA Projects                                          | There are many other projects available on the [Internet Archive github organization page](https://github.com/internetarchive/).

[Kiva Interest Rate Finder](https://github.com/rajbot/kiva_interest_rate)             | Some Kiva Partners charge the equivalent of 80% APR. That is incredibly high. This python script helps you find Kiva Field Partners that charge 0% or low interest. ([github](https://github.com/rajbot/kiva_interest_rate))
